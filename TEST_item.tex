\section{Introduction}
Import item.tex with input and uses it to create an environment for biographies. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Create items with \verb|\bioitem| command with 5 parameters: a unique label wich serves as an ID of the biography, the name, birth date and death date of the figure and a description.
    \item Print with \verb|\printBiography| command.
    \item Cite with \verb|\hyperlink|: \hyperlink{bioNewton}{Newton}.
    \item Cite many times do not causes error: \hyperlink{bioWaring}{Waring1}, \hyperlink{bioWaring}{Waring2}.
    \item If you try to cite an inexistent bioitem then no error is detected but the hyperlink is missed.
    \hyperlink{bioRiemann}{Riemann}
    \item By default all cites are printed even if they have not been cited.
    \item All parameters for each figure need to be defined. I recomend to write \verb|?| for unknown dates.
    \item It is possible to print the pages were a biography was cited with an hyperlink?
\end{itemize}

In future versions this package will be improved.
